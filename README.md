# obsidian-mitre-attack

This repository implements a Python script that parses the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base into a markdown format, making it readable and browsable using the Obsidian note-taking app. 
The ATT&CK data is retrieved from the MITRE GitHub repository (https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data) that contains the dataset represented in STIX 2.1 JSON collection. The main idea behind this project is to make the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base easily accessible and seamlessly integrable into Obsidian, along with reports or your personal notes. Utilizing Obsidian's features such as hyperlinks, tags, graph view, and more can greatly support threat intelligence analysis and investigations.
